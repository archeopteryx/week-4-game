		<h1>Mystery Crystal Number Journey</h1>
	</header>
	
	<section>
		<h3>You have set foot into a cave. 
			<br><br>
			Upon entry, you find a card on the ground with a random number displayed on it. It seems innocuous but instinct alone compells you to place it into your pocket. 
			As you journey further into the cave, you notice there are strange glowing crystals embedded into the cave walls. They provide a pleasant light that renders your lantern near useless.
			The cave feels increasingly cold, lonely, and empty, but these crystals have an alluring warmth.
			It feels endless. Your miles have seemingly made no impact on the length of the jouney, and soon, you can no longer see the entrance to the cave. The monotony sets in. What looks like the same four crystals within the walls continues to taunt you. Have you traveled in a circle? Did you not see the same blue, orange, emerald, and ruby crystaline structures just a moment ago?
			<br><br>
			Giving into temptation, you reach out and touch a small blue crystal. 
			<br><br>
			The warmth spreads through you in a flash. A bright light shines through your pocket. You pull out the card just as the warmth is fading from it. The number has changed! It's decreased by a bit! In the spirit of exploration, you touch the blue crystal again. The warmth returns. The number has decreased by the same amount. 
			<br><br>
			It begs the question.. 
			<br>
			What happens if the number hits zero? Will it help you to find the end of this journey?
			<br>
			Or what happens if you miss zero? Will it doom you to wander the crystal cave for eternity?
